 ## Exploratory and Temporal data analysis

In the `EDA-temporal-analysis.ipynb` notebook, I have undertaken a comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand the intricacies of the satellite images. The notebook highlights:

- Distribution and variance of different S2 images and crop type.
- Temporal changes and trends observed in pixel values, revealing seasonal patterns, changes due to human intervention, and other variations.
